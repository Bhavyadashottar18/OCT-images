# OCT Image Processing and Classification

Welcome to the OCT Image Processing and Classification project!
Step into the world of ophthalmology, where Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) rules diagnosis. OCT isn't just a fancy imaging technique; it's a game-changer in diagnosing and treating eye conditions. Think Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) – OCT sees them all.But it's not just about taking pretty pictures. OCT gives us a close-up view of the retina's inner workings, helping doctors tailor treatments and catch issues early. That's why we're obsessed with getting the clearest, most detailed OCT images possible. It's not just about the tech – it's about making sure we can spot problems before they get serious.
This project involves three main components:

1.⁠ ⁠*Denoising*: OCT images are denoised using CycleGANs.

2.⁠ ⁠*Super-Resolution*: Denoised images are enhanced using ESRGAN for super-resolution.

3.⁠ ⁠*Volumetric Classification*: Super-resolved images are classified using a 3D CNN architecture.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to processing and classifying optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. By combining denoising, super-resolution, and classification techniques, we aim to improve the quality and accuracy of medical imaging analysis.

## Methods

### Denoising with CycleGANs
•⁠  ⁠*Description*: OCT images often contain noise that can hinder analysis. We employ CycleGANs to denoise these images effectively.
•⁠  ⁠*Details*: The CycleGAN model is trained using unpaired datasets to learn how to translate noisy images to denoised ones.

### Super-Resolution with ESRGAN
•⁠  ⁠*Description*: After denoising, we enhance the images using ESRGAN to achieve super-resolution.
•⁠  ⁠*Details*: The ESRGAN model is trained on pairs of low-resolution and high-resolution images to produce high-quality super-resolved images.

### Volumetric Classification with 3D CNN
•⁠  ⁠*Description*: We classify volumetric OCT images using a 3D CNN architecture.
•⁠  ⁠*Details*: The 3D CNN model is trained to classify images into different categories based on their volumetric features.

## Data

•⁠  ⁠*Dataset*: Provide information on the dataset used, including how to obtain it and any preprocessing steps.
•⁠  ⁠*Data Structure*: Describe the data structure and how the data is organized.
